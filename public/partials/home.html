            <p>I discovered my love for programming while attending Monroe College. At the time my major was Information Technology.
                While at the College I took a class on basic C++. I knew right away programming was what I wanted to do.
                I started learning more about programming and quickly moved to programming for Windows Phone 7, Android devices
                and now web development.
            </p>
            <p>My first love was to program for mobile devices, but after being introduced to web development
                (While attending a Coding Bootcamp) I felt I found my place in the programming community.
